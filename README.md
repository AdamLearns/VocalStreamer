## Usage

### Prerequisites

- OBS
- Python 3

### Instructions

- Install [LocalVocal](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-localvocal)
- Add LocalVocal as a filter on your microphone. E.g. my setup looks like this:
  - ![image](https://github.com/AdamLearns/VocalStreamer/assets/60950402/7845078d-d475-4c97-934e-7a7190dbb434)
- Set up scripting in OBS
  - Go to **Tools** â†’ **Scripts**
  - Under the **Python Settings** tab, choose the location to a version of Python that's compatible with OBS. There isn't very much information on how to find that version. I specified this on macOS: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.7_1/Frameworks`.
  - On the **Scripts** tab, add the script from this repo.
- For now, the script has hard-coded parameters, e.g. for the name of the scene to switch to or the name of the microphone to mute, so you have to modify the script directly and then click the "Refresh" button on the **Scripts** tab.
